Module 2 - Stock analysis using VBA

# Challenge
The "green_stocks (Challenge).xlsm" file should have Steve's macros functional via buttons. The code has been refactored over that done for the module. It should now allow Steve to include additional observations of the included stocks, or sheets for other years (so long as the sheets are sorted by stock ticker).
